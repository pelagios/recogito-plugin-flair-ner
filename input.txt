Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the gods now mean that Ulysses should
get home, we should first send Mercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we
have made up our minds and that he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca,
to put heart into Ulysses' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the Achaeans in
assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who persist in eating up
any number of his sheep and oxen; I will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to 
see if he can hear anything about the return of his dear father- for this will make 
people speak well of him.
